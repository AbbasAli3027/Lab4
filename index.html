            My full name is Syed Abbas Ali, but i go by Abbas. I was born in
            Scarborugh but moved to Brampton when i was around 2. I've always
            had a interest in technology and computers, i built my first gaming
            pc when i was 15 and i coded for the first time when i was 17, i
            took a 5 year break from programming as i wanted to explore other
            options. I tried digital marketing and also shortly pursued and
            education in finance, i ultimately decdied developing was the career
            i did want to pursue when i was creating websites using templates
            for some of my digital marketing clients and realized how much fun
            web development was and wanted to learn the ins and outs of it. i
            started diving into react and developed my first professional react
            application for a local barber the site can be found at
            <a href="https://meencutz.com/">meencutz.com</a> but might be a bit
            out of date since the client doesnt cut hair very often anymore so
            the site hasnt been maintained in a while. from there i wanted to
            fine tune my fundamental skills since i jumped straight to
            frameworks and libraries so i took freecodecamps javascript
            datastructures and algorithms course as well as enrolled in humber
            college i worked on that course until school started and finished
            about 85% of it which gave me a good grasp of javascript
            fundamentals but i want to learn even more.

            My hobbies mostly include, playing PS5 or PC games (Sometimes Xbox)
            going to the gym, going on long walks with my dog as well as doing
            leetcode style questions, i find them pretty fun to do because its
            similar to solving a puzzle and it also helps me develop my skills
            in prepartion for interviews.

            My main interest is History and religion,i find it fascinating how
            all these different events and scriptures have shaped our current
            way of life and how studying history can lead you to somewhat
            predict the future (in some cases)

            I would say programming is one of my skills, i am fairly decent with
            terminal commands, as well as react,express,mongoDB and Node. i
            havent cracked them open in a while but i am sure i can adapt once i
            get going again (took a 2 month break before school) i also have
            been lifting weights for 5 years now and have trained a lot of my
            friends, so i would count that as somewhat of a skill too i guess, i
            also am able to do video editing in sony vegas pro and adobe after
            effects because one of my hobbies as a kid was editing call of duty
            trickshotting montages. and lastly i have some decent SEO, and
            graphics design skills from my digial marketing days.
